Collaborative work with Giray Kartopu, CSER.

Samples

  + CdZnS deposited on 1mm aluminoborosilicate via MOCVD
  + Ellipsometry performed at UoL to determine band gap, thickness & composition.
  + CdZnS_699
  + CdZnS_700

Results summary

| ID	| d (nm)	| Eg (eV)	| x (% wt. Zn)  |  
| 699	| 158		| 2.94 +/- 0.05	| 49 +/- 1	|  
| 799	| 132		| 2.90 +/- 0.03 | 45 +/- 1	|  

c.f extracted band gaps with sputtered Cd_(1-x)Zn_xS films (see "eg_vs_x.png")

Eg = mx + C

m = 1.06
C = 2.42 eV
